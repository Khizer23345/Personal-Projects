Hi
quit
I am based on OpenAI's language model technology, with my responses being generated in the style of the GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) series. However, as an AI developed by OpenAI, I do not have a direct version number like "GPT-3" or another specific identifier that I can provide you. If you have questions or need assistance with information, feel free to ask, and I'll do my best to help!
